## Dependencies

Required:

-  `atom_name.txt`
- `pdb_to_gjf_v01.sh`
-  `*.pdb`

## Usage

- Create a folder with an arbitrary name including `atom_name.txt`, `pdb_to_gjf_v01.sh` and  corresponding `*.pdb`
- In this folder, create a new folder named as gjf, where `*.gjf` will be imported
- Run  `pdb_to_gjf_v01.sh` 

## Notes

- the `*.pdb` are generated by [write_pdb](F:\Notes\Typora\Script\write_pdb) script  
- If needed, the parameters in QM calculation in  `*.gjf` should be revisted in `pdb_to_gjf_v01.sh` 
- The `atom_name.txt` is defined by a molecule, which is a coluhere taking a example of ACE_PHE_PHE_NAC. If needed, other  `atom_name.txt` shoud be provided.
